About
-----

This repository is associated with the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 (LASC'13). LASC'13 was part of the STACOM'13 workshop, held in conjunction with MICCAI'13. Seven international research groups, comprising 11 algorithms, participated in the challenge.

For a detailed report, please refer to:

Benchmark for Algorithms Segmenting the Left Atrium From 3D CT and MRI Datasets. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34(7):1460â€“1473, 2015.

The challenge is also featured on [Cardiac Atlas Project].

The Python scripts in this repository take as input a segmentation and output the two evaluation metrics described in the paper.

The data and code of the challenge have been made publicly available to serve as a benchmark for left atrial segmentation algorithms.

Feel free to contact us with any questions.


Abbreviations
-------------

* CT: Computed tomography
* GT: Ground truth
* MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging
* LA: Left atrium
* LASC'13: Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
* PV: Pulmonary vein


Data
----

The benchmark consists of 30 CT and 30 MRI datasets. Per modality, 10 datasets are for training of segmentation algorithms and 20 datasets are for testing.

The MRI datasets are publicly available on Figshare:

* [Training][mri_training]
* [Testing][mri_testing]
* [Results][mri_results]

The data agreement for CT datasets expired on September 2018. Therefore, we can not share these datasets anymore.

Sample data from an arbitrary modality/institute/case were included in this repository to be able to run the scripts.


Instructions
------------

### Run the code

Clone the repository and cd into it:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/catactg/lasc
$ cd lasc
```

Run the following to generate csv-files with metric values:
```sh
$ python code/lasc_benchmark.py data/mri/testing/b002 data/mri/results/UCL_1C/b002/mask.mhd 0
```

### More details

The script `lasc_benchmark.py` calls functions in `lasc_benchmark_tools.py` to extract a surface mesh from the binary mask generated by the participant's segmentation algorithm, run the standardisation, and compute the evaluation metrics.

The benchmark assumes the binary mask to be in mhd + raw format with "inside LA" = 1 and "outside LA" = 0. It also assumes the binary mask and original image to be registered.

Usage of `lasc_benchmark.py`:

```sh
$ python lasc_benchmark.py <path_groundtruth> <segmentation_file> <1|0>
```

with input arguments:

* `<path_groundtruth>`: Path to the testing dataset with the GT
* `<segmentation_file>`: Path to the binary mask generated by the segmentation algorithm
* `<1|0>`: Flag to enable visualisation of the segmentation alongside the GT (both standardised)


Folder structure
